  - body: "## About the Project\n\nHow did the freedpeople of Puerto Rico respond to the conditions of their unfreedom, particularly the imposition of a three-year labor contract mandate, in the wake of abolition? The Libertos de Puerto Rico project (LPR) focuses on the life conditions and lived experiences of libertos - freedpeople - in Puerto Rico in the wake of the 1873 abolition of slavery in the Spanish colony. As a digital humanities project, LPR’s public-facing work includes a bilingual site which makes accessible to Puerto Rican publics in the archipelago and the diaspora general and accurate information about libertos’ experiences with the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico. In addition to the core details, from the text of the abolition law and its subsequent regulations around the post-emancipation contracting mandate, this digital humanities project also works to answer the larger question of how Puerto Rican libertos responded to the conditions imposed on their lives and labor after emancipation.\_\n\nDrawing on a broad range of archival documents collected by project lead Daniel Morales-Armstrong since 2017, the LPR presents understudied and largely-silenced incidents of libertos’ exercising their agency to challenge the contract mandate. Explore the site to learn about the ways libertos and libertas interpreted, responded to, and shaped the landscape of emancipation in Puerto Rico. Begin your journey by reading the [Emancipation Laws and Regulations](https://libertos.netlify.app/en/pages/Laws-and-Regulations) before learning how freedpeople, from Juncos to Santa Isabel and San German, Responded (LINK). Finally, consider the impact of these histories on the Why It Matters (LINK) page, and find resources to read more about the libertos’ lives through the [Selected Bibliography](https://libertos.netlify.app/en/pages/Resources) page.\n\n## Taller Entre Aguas (TEA)\n\nThe Libertos project is a collaborative effort of the [Taller Entre Aguas](https://www.tallerentreaguas.org/) (TEA) research group. TEA is a microlab under the Diaspora Solidarities/Community Knowledge Lab collective, funded by the Mellon Foundation. Our work at TEA is grounded on an ancestral reverence and commitment towards Black Puerto Rican life in data and impact. Our projects include public facing discourse and mentorship, as well as investment in elevating Black life through resource and scholarship.\_\n\nTEA’s portfolio is comprised of three main projects: the Registro Project (focused on analyzing the 1872 Registro de Esclavos), the [Criadas Project](https://www.criadasproject.org/en/criadas) (focused on domestic laborers in pre- and post-emancipation Puerto Rico), and the Libertos Project. We are interested in expanding the ways Black Puerto Ricans gather and think together towards liberation, progress and action. These forms may include methodologies, curriculum, and other documentations for public use that offer best practices for decolonial work. We also aim to engage digital humanities through a diasporic, Black and ethnic studies approach.\n\n#### LPR Members\n\nThe Libertos Project is led by Daniel Morales-Armstrong and includes TEA lab member(s) A and B. \n"
